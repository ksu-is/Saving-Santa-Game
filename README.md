# Saving-Santa-Game
Text-based adventure game with pop-up messages

I plan to create a holiday-themed, text-based adventure game called "Saving Santa". Saving Santa will be an entertaining and interactive experience that allows the user to make choices that impact the progress of the storyline. In this game, players step into the shoes of the hero responsible for saving Christmas when Santa Claus is kidnapped by Krampus. The game will offer an engaging storyline with various decision points that allow players to choose their own paths, ultimately determining whether they succeed in saving Christmas or, inadvertently, bring about chaos and disappointment. It will also include pop-up messages that prompt the user to make a decision, adding a sence of urgency and excitement to the gameplay.
